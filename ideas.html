        <p>Freelance Writing
            One of the reasons freelance writing is so popular is its very low start-up cost. If you have an internet
            connection and keyboard, you are ready to roll. Work on creating samples in the niches you want to write
            about.

            You can house your samples in a free portfolio site like Contently. Or, if you have a little bit of money to
            spend, you can set up your own website to help generate leads and showcase your portfolio.

            To get some of your first writing gigs, check out Craigslist or the ProBlogger Job Board. You can even
            create a gig on Fiverr selling small writing services while you get your start.</p>

        <p> Virtual Assistant
            You can get started as a VA in many of the same ways you would as a freelance writer, but there are a few
            differences. It’s easier to pick up virtual assisting jobs in Facebook Groups than it is on the (very
            limited) job boards. You can also use sites like Fiverr and Upwork to get your first clients.

            You need to decide what services to offer. Here’s a list of VA skills that are in demand.

            Having your own website can help you find work, but if you have solid references you can get away with not
            having a website right away. That said, as you know by now, setting up your own website is still really
            inexpensive, and will help give your business a professional vibe.</p>

        <p>Unlike becoming a rideshare driver which would involve gas money, one of the other more popular sharing
            economy options is renting a room.

            Sites like Airbnb have made it easier than ever to host travelers for a night or two and earn money. For
            your safety, don’t forget to check your potential visitor’s reviews and references.</p>
